The fact that DeepSeek and similar labs are open-sourcing their top models and research is huge. This is what might actually stop the Metas and Googles of the world from building walled gardens and locking down the market for their own profit",

Также супер про LLM на своем компе и сервере. Все были мысли развернуть это у себя. Теперь лучше понимаю с какими сложностями можно столкнуться. Также после просмотра еще сильнее захотелось запилить какого-нибудь ИИ-агента, все давно хочу это сделать. P.S.
