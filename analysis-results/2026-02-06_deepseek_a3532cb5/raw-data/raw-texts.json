    "Let's not let AI turn into a repeat of the late Web 2.0 era, where a few mega-corps cornered the market, forced everyone into subscriptions, and basically laughed at the idea of user choice. The fact that DeepSeek and similar labs are open-sourcing their top models and research is huge. This is what might actually stop the Metas and Googles of the world from building walled gardens and locking down the market for their own profit",

    "Appreciating the persistent quality! Thanks!",
    "Deep seek open source Vs USA proprietary. I choose open source",
    "Deepseek is back? I never went away, if anything the fact that it was open-source and open-weight meant it got integrated into so many systems (including for American companies). It literally became the Android of LLMs and it's not even the top LLM in China anymore, it's now behind Qwen and Kimi. It's amazing the Western world only knows about Deepseek when China has more popular ones out already.",
    "Why is every Chinese technology a threat to US ?.The biggest threat to humanity is posed by US.",

    "Kimi 2.5 blows away all closed US models.  Kimi cost $5,000,000 to train and can be run on home computer.  US closed AI is completely worthless.  Anyone defending Open AI, jewthropic or any of the other closed source AI models, no chance.  Data centers are a total waste of money.  NVDA is going to $0.",
    "DeepSeek really exposes the corporate greed and price gouging of Silicon Valley. China's strategy is clear, destroy Silicon Valley's monopoly with open source tech,  and then clean up afterwards. This strategy is working with solar panels,  EVs, electric batteries. Predatory capitalism at its most ruthless.",
    "I didn’t consider China’s AI capabilities seriously until early January 2026, when Kimi K2.5 was released.",
    "US and whoever threw money at OpenAi....",
    "It's America vs China, them America vs the rest of the world. I am an African and not afraid of China",
    "Wow as a person working on AI, hearing this conversation is pretty funny 😂\nAs if a better chip makes a better model 😂😂😂",
    "I've used deepseek extensively generating legal documents. Have to mind your prompts and check for mistakes but it's revolutionary. \n\nI've used it a wee bit with one coding project  though I don't know current version saves time with bugs it introduces. \n\nAs someone living in America I much prefer the AI I use be in a different jurisdiction.",
    "How else could the CEO of an American AI company persuade investors to buy more stock in their company if he didn't lie?",
    "What makes American AI advanced? Chatting? Smart people know China has already won. China has no rivals in AI applications across various industries. The Chinese will tell you that there will never be true AGI, only industry-specific AGI",
    "这位 华人面孔的亚洲人，对中国的AI认知不全面\ndeepseekAI并没有适配英伟达芯片，只适配了华为等的国产芯片",
    "Huawei Ascend 9xx series AI chips have existed for years now. They're not working on them, they have them and all the big datacenter companies in China like Alibaba and Tencent are buying them for AI even now after export restriction on Nvidia GPUs has been lifted. The benefit to using a chip that may be only 60% of the performance of the nvidia equivalent is the significan cost savings and not having long wait times for delivery in large quantity",
    "China is an energy superpower and knows that if AI really kicks off, it will have the upper hand in processing and costs.  So it is to the advantage of China to make sure their models are open, inspectable, trustable.  Especially with the raising anti-USA sentiment building worldwide.",
    "and I had been using AI agents on my phone purchashing stuff on my chinese phone. Something that both Google and Apple failed so far",
    "Currently US AI application is focusing on replacing low level white collar jobs.  Amazon just announced a major lay off in Seattle area that also hits the mid level white collar.  Local sandwich shops are hit hard.",
    "Kimi 2.5 is also up there. The transparency and control of your own data AND being FREE is highly appealing.",
    "I prefer Deepseek. 😂",
    "Knowledgeable hosts and guests 👍👍👍👍👍👍",
    "I just love deepseek and use it a lot for philosophy, metaphysics and psychology. It has helped me so much in certain abstract areas, about subconscious mind manifestations and such.",
    "5 years ago this would have sounded impossible.",
    "I love deepseek because it can extend and critique my Philosophical & Epistemological  ideas.",
    "I have used DeepSeek since it debuted for both physics and mathematics.  It is far better than other AI systems.",
    "I've been using Claude in a similar fashion. Having an agent do the calculations for me saves me so much time modeling and I don't have to write the py scripts anymore. Love it",
    "2026. AI is more scientific than most scientists.",
    "Wow.  Just wow.  This, I think, is how AI will help us moving forward.  Not an all powerful AI that knows and does everything for us.  But rather, an assistant.  An extra brain we can query.  It's going to be amazingly helpful to us as individuals and sociability.  Not the vision of the tech bros.  But something revolutionary and awesome that nobody can quite see yet.  Thanks for this fantastic demo.  I'm geeked for the future of science and society!",
    "This AI is way above my head, I feel like an Australopithecus. In any case a variable speed of light is interesting concept.",
    "It's a great way to explore ideas limited largely by one's own domain expertise. It suffers for the same reason",
    "loved the video, keep them coming :)",
    "Such an interesting video - considering my knowledge of physics has  unfortunately disappeared over the years 🙂",
    "At least it can help your paper published faster.",
    "Thanks very much. It looks great fun.",
    "Very Exciting. Congratulations on your successful interaction with the Deep Seek! Great video, thanks",
    "Super Video danke🎉",
    "I am curious whether you have tried the same with other models and what are the results.  It would be interesting to compare.  Thanks !",
    "you concepts are close to my stationary model interesting",
    "Thank for share your thoughts",
    "The connection I see in Mach's principle is that the age we see the universe to be is more a consequence of only being able to see the parts not moving away from us faster than light. Gravity is going to come from a small effect but with a similar cause but in the subatomic accelerations meaning some part of the forces seen are screened.",
    "A Unified Theory of Cognitive Dynamics: The Physics of Information Processing at the Edge of Chaos",
    "The exact same process works for very difficult problems in logic/philosophy. I don't think academics have quite yet grasped the extent and depth of the AI revolution taking place right now. It's actively solving ancient problems in completely fresh ways, and it's like an informational atomic bomb in terms of foundational legal systems, religion, and memetic power structures.",
    "Hmmm… I would be interested in the effect of expansion creating a horizon when summing over the universe.",
    "I use it always,for helping me in marketing.",
    "My friend sent me this, saying \"I think this guy is saying what you're saying!\" - and, I think you are!  I was coming at it from the cosmological and quantum angles, this is from the newtonian, and you understand the math a lot better than me.  I'm coming at this all from process-relational thought.  I put some stuff up on substack, if anyone who understood this video wants to run a framework by a robot and see if it solves the Crisis in Cosmology how I think it does, I would really love the feedback - tarnin on substack.  I'm excited to see what other videos you've made after seeing this one.",
    "Deepseek is the best when it comes to math related subjects.",
    "Starting from the first principles, quantum world is holistic so the mathematical gravity model needs also the be holonomic instead of reductionistic. Machian rotation can be approached purely geometrically without assuming inherent existence of mass: cycloidic gravity pressure of Huygens-Bohm model and proton mass as inertial anti-gravity which prevents total collapse due to holonomic pressure of temporal least action principle of tautochrone cycloid and cycloid as it's own involute - cf. Bohmian active information.\n\nDeepSeek can catch up quite well with this general hypothesis.",
    "Time and gravity is a consequence of light.",
    "My experience with these things regarding the foundation of physics (which is extensive):  You can't rely on anything until you reduce it to algorithmic construction and run the code to constructively prove the asserted theory.  This is intermediate empirical testing short of constructing the physical apparatus required for experimental tests.  It's hard work no one wants to do.",
    "I like to see a similar demo on Higgs. \nWhat is the hope for AI in experimental design.",

How much worry have you brought to investors in Taipei when you considered taking a sack from Chinese Quantitative easing process. Or the time you pulled back your advance A.I Chips, just to let the Chinese to continue holding on to U.S bonds.. Comments on your support for DeepSeek shows which side of the deal you leaning towards.. Why not Talk about 'Liquides imaginaires' instead",
    "Never thought my XA60R bag would pass my QNT and HBAR, but it just did.",
    "Jensen Huang is always selling and pumping his company.  It's no wonder the A. I. bubble won't burst.  He's a salesman and entertainer constantly charming his fans. His song and dance convinces corporations to spend tens of billions of dollars on GPUs they don't even need.  I wish Apple had just one guy like Huang.  Steve Jobs could do it, but those days are long gone for Apple.  Apple has some really great products, but Apple's marketing department is weak. \nHuang is the type of dude who could sell refrigerators to Eskimos in igloos.",

    "I moved over to Chinese models after being f*cked over by google. The cost saving was unbelievable.",
    "I am glad for China. It is time for all countries of the world to limit their reliance with the US bully.",
    "Go China many are with you!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",
    "If our reply is to slow down the avalanche we already lost... self-defeated! Very interesting indeed",
    "The US forced out the Chinese. Now the Chinese will become self reliant and replace the US companies as market leaders. It will happen and US greed is to blame.",

    "If China can produce competitive GPUs then it will be better for consumers finally bringing down the hoarding and ever growing cost of computing",
    "Free competition is good for consumers.",
    "Wow, 4 hours old and already out of date.   Deep seek models are being used across the US, Canada, Australia, EU, way above any other.",
    "The electricity capacity per capita in China is less than U.S.  However, their distribution is different, their average consumption of electricity per capita is roughly 1/8 of US, so they are able to allocating more to manufacture, public transportation and technology, and their infrastructure is newer and more efficient than US.  Thus, China does have power advantage on AI development.  In addition, China is developing new and more renewable energy sources.  For example the new high attitude wind power S2000 has 12 generators and super high voltage cable in Xinjiang can easily power data center in remote areas.",
    "China + Canada = Chinada = both countries get rich together 🥰",

    "You guys had a broad conversation over tech.... The only thing I would add to that conversation. Tim Cook and team Apple really doesn't have to create an AI agent from my perspective. Siri can be the base part of the device, but if a user wanted to supplement her for another source; then there is a market for that. There is a in between point from these AI companies and being REALLY integrated into ANY devices and then.... it's just a matter at what cost to the end user and it can be scalable pending on the customer... in so many ways.",

    "Anybody contemplating what intelligence will look like is it in our own interpretation of that or does technology present in another fashion. If we imagined how an advance civilization present there technology to us today would it be the same or far different. So in that thought process what would robots be constructed of and how would it intermingle with us humans. More importantly I don’t think it would resemble our form or movements.",

    "Louis Vincent Gave said it correctly when he said that without the US ban on chips export to China, Chinese tech giants would have followed the American tech giants into spending tens of billions on chips. But because of the ban, instead it forced the Chinese tech companies to be more innovative and efficient, that's why they have no AI bubble problem like in the US while still being innovative.",

    "No, its not too few, but rather its too many videos.\n\nQuality should be over quantity\n\nUploading everyday is too often, let alone 2 videos per day, its just too many\n\nDespite consistently uploading yet the number of viewer stuck and didnt grow much, as well as the number of subscribers\n\nAlso the informations contained in the videos mostly are the same repetition from previous videos\n\nI have been following the channel and want to continue but struggling with the pace of the new video upload. Watching the same repetition informations cost me my time yet i dont want to miss a single video coz i dont know which video contain valuable and important informations",

Но что удивительно, ребята обсуждали темы, которые я сам обсуждал с гугловским ии пару дней назад. Не все разумеется. Но тема разделения обязанностей, для снижения всезнайства, и одновременно - требований к железу у меня возникла тоже. Постановщик задачь- это один ии, а исполнители, заточенные под локальные задачи- это другой. И как оказалось- эта тема в тренде у разработчиков",
    "Спасибо. Интересно было послушать про Дипсик от профи. Упоминания про рейтинги. Я про них слышал, но их что-то очень много. Теперь буду понимать на какие рейтинги ориентируются профи. Исходя из этой мысли было полезно узнать про Грок. А также про 2 вкладки с двумя топовыми ИИ для разных работ. Все это возьму на заметку. Также супер про LLM на своем компе и сервере. Все были мысли развернуть это у себя. Теперь лучше понимаю с какими сложностями можно столкнуться. Также после просмотра еще сильнее захотелось запилить какого-нибудь ИИ-агента, все давно хочу это сделать. P.S. Ну и напоследок, вернулся к видео и сейчас пиши этот коммент, так как захотел посмотреть вшитый промт :)",

    "Fantastic breakdown of the latest AI developments! It’s incredible to see how rapidly the landscape is shifting from simple chat interfaces to full agentic workflows. Kimi K2.5’s vision and tool integration are standout features, making it a powerful assistant for real-world tasks. The focus on long-context reasoning in Qwen3-Max and Anthropic's MCP integration also signal a huge leap in productivity. Thanks for keeping us updated with such high-quality insights—can't wait to see what's next",
